* I have created Data.js containing a JSON object representing questions, answer options and correct answers for a questionnaire.

* Using this data created a form, that iterating over the questions and answer options from the JSON.

* The form contains “Submit” and “Reset” buttons for submitting and clearing the form respectively

* Validations :  * All the questions should be answered , in case of a missing answer, the question will be highlighted in red colour

* On submit of the form, it calculates the correct and incorrect answers as well and display the results in the form of a simple bar chart.

* On clicking the “Reset” button it resets the form and clears the bar graph

* The UI is responsive.

* Stack Used : React + Redux
